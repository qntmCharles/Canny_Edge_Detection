Plan:
1: Gaussian Blur [DONE]
2: Sobel [DONE]
3: Non-Maximum Suppression [DONE]
4: Hysteresis Thresholding [DONE]
5: GUI
	5.1 Requirements:
		-Tick boxes to include/exclude stage - how the hell will that work???
		-Timer
		-Save all images at once - do a file structure thing to store all the images nicely, then add to design

TODO:
-Store binary images rather than 0s and 255s?

-In write up:
	-in HCI: gestalt principles of organisation
	-in analysis research section: point out that thresholding hysteresis often split into two stages

-Data storage

-Compare to code bookmarked on Chrome:
	-Does NMS give the same result - NO - try old NMS algorithm
	-Connected component detection - recursive - is it faster?
	-Does my program actually remove weak edges that are left over?
	-Compare entire program - where is it different and is it better
	-Does thresholding method work better (probably, try it) kindaaaa?

-Fix NMS, or whatever else is wrong
	-Why are there still some interpolation errors

-GUI:
	-Save all button
	-Set default keys e.g. esc to exit a dialog
	-(in individual options) Add a 'load from current process' for options after gblur, 
	so that you can go straight from gblur to sobel (for example) 
	without having to save and then load
	-Add a dropdown menu to select sigma and radius
	Bugs:
		-Cancelling, loading a new image, and then running causes errors: clock counts in twos, starts to terminate again
		-Yeah it's seriously broken if you cancel and then restart...

-Fix thresholding:
	-Can I threshold the image differently to get better thresholds
	-Does the function work properly?
	-Are there better methods of thresholding

-Comment that shit:
	-gaussian [DONE]
	-convolution [DONE]
	-nms - ugh do I have to?
	-main
	-sobel [DONE]
	-hysteresis [DONE]
	-threshold [DONE]

Potential:
-Change gaussian kernel radius to be 6*sigma
-Fiddle with algorithm for hysteresis to get it to work better (?)
-Investigate dynamic thresholds
