TODO:

-Write up:
	-Fix references to figures - (all/some) are incorrect

-Testing:
	-deliberately break some things then fix them
	-make sure the core objectives are shown to have been met
	-use the problem with NMS (the kernels being backwards and the >=) as an example
	-checkExists test? kinda boring...
	-time the recursive and procedural versions of hysteresis
	-check timer is accurate
	-gaussian kernel values test - before normalisation and then show that normalisation needed
	-tests for NMS showing displayRegion, interpolated stuff etc
	-otsu testing
	-test save all dialog (have different options saved in different formats with diff names)
	"""
	-GUI testing on separate platforms 
		-how tf do I make file system roots work?!
		-might require an icon for the taskbar on windows
	"""
	-When testing is done, remove oldHysteresis

-Evaluation
	-GUI:
		-A focus event when a window is opened by a button, but then disappears - to stop it being hidden by the main window
			-(Would require threading)

	-NMS/sobel: could've put the gradient mag, magH, magV and direction into a single structure, as a vector. 
		Would be much nicer. 

	-Open multiple images into a queue

To ask Liam:
	-Do I need to add more exception handling?
	-Replace numpy functions

-Coding
	-Display path to the loaded image
