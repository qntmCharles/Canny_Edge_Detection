Plan:
1: Gaussian Blur [DONE]
2: Sobel [DONE]
3: Non-Maximum Suppression [DONE]
4: Hysteresis Thresholding [DONE]
5: GUI

TODO:
-Store binary images rather than 0s and 255s? Perhaps add an option to save as binary image

-In write up:
	-in HCI: gestalt principles of organisation
	-in design: data flow table!
	-in design: update /everything/
	-in analysis research section: point out that thresholding hysteresis will be split into two separate stages
	-point out that progress bar is inferior to a timer - it is not known how much processing is needed so a progress bar is not suitable, timer lets you know it's still going
	-data storage

-Hysteresis:
	-Connected component detection - make it recursive - test if faster using timeit

-Fix NMS: 
	-pretty sure checkExists works, for indices on the left side of the image
	-test this ^

-Thresholding:
	-remove otsu

-GUI:
	-split into separate modules
	-add a focus event (if that's what it's meant to be?) that will focus on the right window when a button that has already been clicked is clicked e.g. image show

-Comment that shit:
	-gaussian [DONE]
	-convolution [DONE]
	-nms
	-main
	-sobel [DONE]
	-hysteresis [DONE]
	-threshold [DONE]
	-gui

Potential:
-Change gaussian kernel radius to be 6*sigma
-Investigate dynamic thresholds
