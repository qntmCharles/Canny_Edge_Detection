TODO:

-Write up:
	-Fix references to figures - (all/some) are incorrect
	-Add "time" module to list

-Testing:
	-With the following sections, ensure there is expected, extreme and erroneous data:
		-Image thresholding
		-File loading (load a HUGE file)

	-Time the timer
	-use the problem with NMS (the kernels being backwards and the >=) as an example (with the simple.bmp image)

-Evaluation
	-GUI:
		-A focus event when a window is opened by a button, but then disappears - to stop it being hidden by the main window
			-(Would require threading)

	-NMS/sobel: could've put the gradient mag, magH, magV and direction into a single structure, as a vector. 
		Would be much nicer. 

	-Open multiple images into a queue
	-Better root directories for saving files
	-Think how to deal with a vector being 0 in interpolate/nms

To ask Liam:
	-Do I need to add more exception handling?
	-Replace numpy functions
