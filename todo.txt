Plan:
1: Gaussian Blur [DONE]
2: Sobel [DONE]
3: Non-Maximum Suppression [DONE]
4: Hysteresis Thresholding [DONE]
5: GUI
	5.1 Requirements:
		-Buttons for each stage
		-Open image
		-Save image - to be made possible after each stage
		-Tick boxes to include/exclude stage - how the hell will that work???
		-Timer
		-Save all images at once - do a file structure thing to store all the images nicely, then add to design

TODO:
Urgent:
-Change g in convolution to k or kernel
-Store binary images rather than 0s and 255s?
-Turn images into a class: DONE. Need to change all the modules into methods and then take self, an Imaage obj, and take what they need.
-GUI
-Comment that shit:
	-gaussian [DONE]
	-convolution [DONE]
	-nms - ugh do I have to?
	-main
	-sobel [DONE]
	-hysteresis
	-threshold [DONE]
Potential:
-Change gaussian kernel radius to be 6*sigma
-Fiddle with algorithm for hysteresis to get it to work better (?)
-Investigate dynamic thresholds
-Try using multiprocessing (maaaaaybe)
