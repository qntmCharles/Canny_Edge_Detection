Plan:
1: Gaussian Blur [DONE]
2: Sobel [DONE]
3: Non-Maximum Suppression
	3.1 Iterate through horiz, vert
		3.1.1 Iterate over image
			3.1.1.1 Check if local maximum and assign value
4: Hysteresis Thresholding
5: GUI




TODO:
-Make sure it's converted to grayscale at the beginning
-Investigate dynamic thresholds
-Try using multiproccessing (maybe)
-WHY ISN'T IT FINDING THE RIGHT EDGES!?
-Improve non-maximum suppression algorithm - linear interpolation (the program
		won't work until this is done. Need to change 'h' and 'v' to correct
		angles.)
-Edge handling for non maximum suppression algorithm
